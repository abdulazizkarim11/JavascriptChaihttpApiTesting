# ChaiHttp with Mocha & Javascript

The mini-project I created to practice API testing. I used chaiHttp because it was easy to follow and understand. ChaiHttp tests HTTP apps or external services and provides chai expect and should interfaces.

For me, I believe this is a straight forward process. Install the Mocha framework followed by installing chaiHttp and start automating API request and responses. 

The next step is to test API request & responses. Online there are tons of information and helpful websites which you can explore but I decided to set up my JSON server so I can get my own full fake REST API.

Useful websites which you may want visit to get test data:
